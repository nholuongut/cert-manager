# The AWS Route53 solver uses AWS SDK for Go V2, which can get
# credentials and region information from environment variables. So
# configuration is not **required**.
# This integration test demonstrates that the OpenAPI validation
# **and** webhook validation permit such an empty Route53 stanza.
# YAML and unstructured are used, instead of cert-manager API types to
# avoid confusion around zero values for strings such as region.
